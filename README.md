<h2>üìù Notes</h2>

<p>You can use <b>Prisma Stuido</b> for checking data on UI</p>

```
npx prisma studio
```

<p>You can use <b>Redis CLI</b> for checking data on cli</p>

```
docker exec -it redis redis-cli
```

<p<b>Concurrency Note:</b> In the project, Node.js's robust event loop and Redis's <b>"Fixed Window"</b> algorithm have been harnessed to ensure the safe and efficient handling of concurrent operations. Node.js's event-driven architecture facilitates the management of multiple operations happening simultaneously, while Redis's Fixed Window mechanism controls the rate at which requests are permitted, preventing overloading of shared resources. This combination effectively safeguards against concurrency issues, ensuring data integrity and resource protection.</p>
